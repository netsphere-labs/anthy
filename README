What's Anthy?
=============

Anthy is a library for Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion, targeted for
Japanese text input.

See following page for Anthy development:
	http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianAnthy
	http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-anthy/anthy.git;a=summary


What's New?
===========

See the file NEWS for new features and other user-visible changes in
recent versions of Anthy.


Installation
============

The file INSTALL says how to build and install Anhty on your system.


Configuration 
=============

System administrator is expected to set up following three variables
in anthy-conf.in (usually it's under /etc/anthy directory).

    Variable name  Example                         # Comment
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    ANTHYDIR       /usr/share/anthy                # Directory 
    DIC_FILE       /usr/share/anthy/anthy.dic      # Dictionary file
    ZIPDICT        /usr/share/anthy/dic/zipcode.t  # Zipcode file


Anthy Dictionary (anthy.dic)
============================

Here is a figure to explain how Anthy Dictionary (anthy.dic) is
generated.

   depgraph/*.depword
   depgraph/conjugate.table
    ---[depgraph/mkdepgraph]---> anthy.dep (1)

   mkworddic/{extra.t,compound.t,adjust.t,utf8.t,udict},
   alt-cannadic/{gcanna.ctd,gcannf.ctd,gtankan.ctd,g_fname.t}
    ---[mkworddic/mkworddic]---> anthy.wdic (2)

   "initial anthy.dic"
   corpus/corpus.?.txt
    ---[calctrans/{proccorpus,calctrans}]---> corpus_info (3-1)
    					      weak_words  (3-2)

      calctrans/{corpus_info,weak_words} (3-1,3-2)
       ---[calctrans/calctrans]---> anthy.cand_info (3)
       				    anthy.trans_info (4)
				    anthy.corpus_array (5)
				    anthy.corpus_bucket (6)
      				    anthy.weak_words (7)

         (1) depgraph/anthy.dep
         (2) mkworddic/anthy.wdic
         (3) calctrans/anthy.cand_info
         (4) calctrans/anthy.trans_info
         (5) calctrans/anthy.corpus_array
         (6) calctrans/anthy.corpus_bucket
         (7) calctrans/anthy.weak_words
          ---[mkanthydic/mkfiledic]--->anthy.dic

Note that we need "initial anthy.dic" to generate anthy.dic, that's
because 'proccorpus' uses Anthy Dictionary to parse text input.
